   - All file upload functionality mirrored
   - Consistent UI/UX across both admin pages

## How Image Upload Works

### Complete Flow:

1. **User Selects File**
   - User clicks upload zone or Change Image button
   - File input dialog opens
   - User selects image file (jpg, png, gif, webp)

2. **Client-Side Validation**
   - Validates file type (only images allowed)
   - Validates file size (max 5MB)
   - Shows error toast if validation fails
   - Creates preview using FileReader API

3. **Image Preview**
   - Shows preview immediately (before upload)
   - Preview displayed in 48px height container
   - Object-contain ensures proper aspect ratio
   - User can change or remove image before submitting

4. **Form Submission**
   - User fills other fields (name, price, category)
   - Clicks Create/Update button
   - Sets isUploading to true (disables buttons, shows spinner)

5. **Image Upload (if file selected)**
   - Frontend calls uploadImage(file) from api.ts
   - Creates FormData with file
   - POSTs to /api/upload endpoint
   - Backend multer processes file:
     - Validates file type
     - Checks file size
     - Generates unique filename
     - Saves to /backend/uploads directory
   - Returns: { success, data: { filename, path, size, mimetype } }
   - Frontend receives full URL: http://localhost:5000/uploads/filename.jpg

6. **Save Menu Item/Category**
   - Frontend calls menuItemsApi.create() or .update()
   - Sends image URL along with other data
   - Backend saves to MongoDB
   - Image URL stored as string in database

7. **Display Images**
   - Backend serves images via: GET /uploads/:filename
   - Frontend uses getImageUrl() helper to handle:
     - New uploaded images: http://localhost:5000/uploads/...
     - Legacy URL images: https://example.com/...
     - Public assets: /images/...
   - Fallback to /placeholder.svg if no image

### API Endpoints:

**POST /api/upload**
- Accepts: multipart/form-data with 'image' field
- Returns: { success: true, data: { filename, path, size, mimetype } }
- Errors: 400 (validation), 500 (server error)

**GET /uploads/:filename**
- Serves static image file
- Handled by Express static middleware

**DELETE /api/upload/:filename**
- Deletes uploaded image file
- Returns: { success: true, message }

## Testing the Feature

### Prerequisites:
1. Backend server running on port 5000
2. Frontend server running on port 3000
3. MongoDB connected
4. User logged in with admin access

### Test Cases:

#### 1. Create Menu Item with Image
```bash
1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/admin
2. Click "Add Menu Item"
3. Fill in name, price, category
4. Click the upload zone
5. Select an image file (jpg, png, gif, webp)
6. Verify preview appears
7. Click "Create"
8. Verify "Uploading..." then "Saving..." states
9. Verify menu item appears in table with image
10. Check backend: ls backend/uploads/ (should see uploaded file)
```

#### 2. Edit Menu Item - Change Image
```bash
1. Click Edit button on existing menu item
2. Verify current image shows in preview
3. Click "Change Image"
4. Select new image
5. Verify new preview appears
6. Click "Update"
7. Verify image updated in table
```

#### 3. Edit Menu Item - Remove Image
```bash
1. Click Edit button on item with image
2. Click X (remove) button
3. Verify preview disappears
4. Click "Update"
5. Verify item shows placeholder image in table
```

#### 4. Create Category with Image
```bash
1. Navigate to "Manage Categories"
2. Click "Add Category"
3. Fill in ID and name
4. Upload image
5. Verify upload and creation works
6. Check image appears in categories table
```

#### 5. Validation Tests
```bash
# Invalid file type:
1. Try to upload .txt, .pdf, .zip file
2. Verify error toast: "Only image files are allowed"

# File too large:
1. Try to upload image > 5MB
2. Verify error toast: "File size too large"

# Network error simulation:
1. Stop backend server
2. Try to upload image
3. Verify error toast with appropriate message
```

#### 6. Order Taker View
```bash
1. Create menu items with uploaded images
2. Navigate to main order taker view (/)
3. Verify images load correctly from backend
4. Check browser console for any 404 errors
```

### Manual API Testing:
```bash
# Test upload endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/upload \
  -F "image=@/path/to/test-image.jpg"

# Expected response:
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "filename": "test-image-1234567890-123456789.jpg",
    "path": "/uploads/test-image-1234567890-123456789.jpg",
    "size": 123456,
    "mimetype": "image/jpeg"
  },
  "message": "File uploaded successfully"
}

# Test image serving
curl -I http://localhost:5000/uploads/test-image-1234567890-123456789.jpg
# Should return: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

# Test delete endpoint
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:5000/api/upload/test-image-1234567890-123456789.jpg
```

## Breaking Changes & Migration

### Breaking Changes:
**None** - Fully backward compatible!

The implementation handles both:
- New uploaded images: `http://localhost:5000/uploads/filename.jpg`
- Existing URL-based images: `https://example.com/image.jpg`
- Public folder images: `/images/logo.png`

The `getImageUrl()` helper function automatically detects the format.

### Migration Notes:
1. **No database migration needed** - image field still stores strings
2. **Existing menu items/categories continue to work** - old URLs still functional
3. **New items can use either method** - upload OR URL (though UI now encourages upload)
4. **Gradual migration possible** - update images as needed, no rush

### Environment Variables:
No new environment variables required. Uses existing:
- `FRONTEND_URL` or defaults to `http://localhost:3000`
- `PORT` or defaults to `5000`

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security:
1. **File Type Validation** - Only images allowed (jpg, jpeg, png, gif, webp)
2. **File Size Limit** - Maximum 5MB per file
3. **Unique Filenames** - Prevents overwriting, adds timestamp + random number
4. **MIME Type Checking** - Validates both extension and MIME type
5. **Error Handling** - Graceful error messages, no stack traces to client

### Future Enhancements:
1. **Image Optimization** - Resize/compress images on upload
2. **Multiple Images** - Support multiple images per item
3. **CDN Integration** - Upload to S3/Cloudinary for production
4. **Image Metadata** - Store alt text, captions
5. **Orphan Cleanup** - Delete unused uploaded images
6. **Admin Permissions** - Restrict upload to admin role only

2. Verify file is valid image format
3. Check backend logs for detailed error
4. Verify uploads directory has write permissions
5. Check CORS settings if cross-origin

### Preview not showing:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify FileReader API supported
3. Check file is valid image
4. Clear browser cache

## Production Deployment Notes

### Before deploying to production:

1. **Environment Variables:**
   ```bash
   FRONTEND_URL=https://yourdomain.com
   PORT=5000
   ```

2. **Uploads Directory:**
   - Ensure uploads/ directory exists on server
   - Verify write permissions
   - Consider volume mount for Docker
   - Consider S3/Cloudinary for scalability

3. **Nginx Configuration (if using):**

   }
   ```

4. **Security:**
   - Enable HTTPS
   - Add rate limiting to upload endpoint
