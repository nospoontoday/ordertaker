# Split Payment Feature

## Overview
Implemented a split payment feature that allows order takers to accept payments using both Cash and GCash in a single transaction, improving UX by reducing clicks and eliminating manual calculations.

## User Flow

### Before (Old Way)
1. Customer says "I have â‚±150 cash, rest on GCash"
2. Order taker manually calculates: â‚±457.50 - â‚±150 = â‚±307.50
3. Process as two separate transactions (complex, error-prone)

### After (New Way)
1. Click **ðŸ”€ Split** button
2. Dialog opens showing total amount
3. Click quick amount button (â‚±50, â‚±100, â‚±500, etc.) OR type exact amount
4. GCash amount auto-calculates
5. Click **Complete Payment** - Done! âœ…

## UI Components

### Payment Buttons
Located at the top right of order cards in:
- Active Orders
- Served (Not Paid)

Buttons available:
- **ðŸ’µ Cash** - Full cash payment
- **â’¼ GCash** - Full GCash payment
- **ðŸ”€ Split** - NEW! Split payment dialog

### Split Payment Dialog
Features:
- **Total Amount Display** - Shows order total (read-only)
- **Cash Input** - Number pad optimized input with quick amount buttons
- **Quick Buttons** - â‚±50, â‚±100, â‚±200, â‚±500, â‚±1000 for fast input
- **Auto-calculated GCash** - Remaining balance updates automatically
- **Payment Summary** - Shows breakdown before confirming
- **Validation** - Ensures amounts are valid and total matches

## Technical Implementation

  paymentMethod?: "cash" | "gcash" | "split" | null
  cashAmount?: number        // NEW
  gcashAmount?: number       // NEW
  // ... existing fields
}
```

#### API Updates
- `lib/api.ts` - Updated togglePayment and toggleAppendedPayment to support split payments

### Backend Changes

- Split payment: Shows **ðŸ’µ â‚±150.00** + **â’¼ â‚±307.50** badges

## Database Schema

### Main Order
```javascript
{
  isPaid: Boolean,
  paymentMethod: String, // 'cash' | 'gcash' | 'split' | null
  cashAmount: Number,    // Optional, for split payments

}
```

```javascript
{
  isPaid: Boolean,
  paymentMethod: String, // 'cash' | 'gcash' | 'split' | null

  gcashAmount: Number,   // Optional, for split payments
}
```

## Benefits

1. **Faster Checkout** - 2-3 taps vs manual calculation
2. **Error Prevention** - Auto-calculation eliminates math errors
3. **Better UX** - Quick amount buttons speed up common amounts
